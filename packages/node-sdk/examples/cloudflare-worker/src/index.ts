/**
 * This is a simple example of how to use the Reflag SDK in a Cloudflare Worker.
 * It demonstrates how to initialize the client and evaluate flags.
 * It also shows how to flush the client and wait for any in-flight requests to complete.
 *
 * Set the BUCKET_SECRET_KEY environment variable in wrangler.jsonc to get started.
 *
 * - Run `yarn run dev` in your terminal to start a development server
 * - Open a browser tab at http://localhost:8787/ to see your worker in action
 * - Run `yarn run deploy` to publish your worker
